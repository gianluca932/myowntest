# Chat with Typescript, Redux Toolkit, Web Sockets
> :zap: Frontend engineer position


Javascript and Typescript is in our DNA. You can decide to start from scratch or use CRA (Create React App), Next.JS, Node, etc. based on your preference. We really appreciate tests, UI skills and code organization and linting. We are less focused on UI in this challenge, but please consider creating a nice presentation.

## :triangular_ruler: UI expectation

The application  act like a commonly used chat system - having your message on one side and the buddy messages on the other side. We want to handle multi-party chat including other information like date, time, and what ever you think can be useful. To differentiate users, the chat message bubble should be in different colors (every user an unique color) and every user should have an avatar based on the initials of his or her name (Ex. John Doe -> JD)
